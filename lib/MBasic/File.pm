# ============================================================================
#  MBasic::File -- one terminal-format file channel (#1..#4).
#
#  Terminal-format files are the only kind Explore uses: a sequence of lines
#  of ASCII text.  We hold the file's lines in memory (loaded on open), serve
#  reads from a cursor, and flush writes back to disk.
#
#  Model / semantics (from AM82-01 + verified Multics behaviors):
#    open(path):   load the file's lines if it exists; if absent, start empty.
#                  LAZY -- a missing file does NOT error on open; it simply
#                  reads as immediately at-end (verified: `file` on a
#                  nonexistent file makes `if end` true, no error).
#    input fields: fields are delimited by COMMA or NEWLINE; the cursor
#                  advances past the delimiter.  Reads span lines as needed.
#    linput:       returns the rest of the current line (a whole line), cursor
#                  moves to the start of the next line.
#    print:        the FIRST print sets the pointer to END (append).  We model
#                  print as appending a line to the buffer (BASIC print #n
#                  writes a line of output; a trailing ';' would suppress the
#                  newline, but Explore's print #n statements each emit one
#                  logical line -- see note).  Writes flush to disk.
#    scratch:      erase all content, cursor to beginning.
#    reset:        cursor to beginning (re-read).
#    at_end:       true when the cursor is past the last datum.
#
#  NOTE on print #n and ';':  a print list builds one output line; a trailing
#  ';' suppresses the newline so the NEXT print continues the same line.  We
#  track a pending (unterminated) output line and only commit it as a buffer
#  line when a newline is produced (print with no trailing ';', or an explicit
#  break).  For Explore's usage each print #n produces a complete comma-joined
#  line, so this is straightforward.

# ---- writing ----
# print a rendered chunk to the file's current output line; if $newline,
# terminate the line (commit it to the buffer).  First write triggers append
# semantics: the pointer is at end, so we append new lines to {lines}.
#
# NOTE on Multics vs Unix visibility:  On Multics, print writes into the
# single-level-store segment but the segment's BIT-COUNT (recorded length)
# lags until close (or an adjust_bit_count/abc call), so an EXTERNAL process
# reading mid-run sees "zero length" or stale data -- which is exactly why the
# game uses the "reopen the channel" trick or `abc` before other players read
# a shared file.  On Unix we flush eagerly here so a player who RE-OPENS the
# shared file sees prior writes at once (the behavior the game's abc/trick
# machinery was straining to achieve on Multics), and `abc` becomes a harmless
# no-op.  Same-program reads are served from {lines}.
#
# Caveat: the atomic-rename flush (see _flush) replaces the file's inode, so a
# process holding the OLD file descriptor open keeps reading the old content;
# visibility requires re-opening by path (which the game always does).  This is
# the normal trade-off for crash-safe replacement, and per-print flushing means
# every print #n rewrites the whole (small) file -- fine for the game's use.

# flush buffered content to disk (called on scratch, close, and after writes).
#
# Strategy 1 -- atomic temp-file + rename (the default).  Crash-safe (a partial
# or ENOSPC write never truncates the real file), and it replaces a planted
# symlink AT THE TARGET rather than clobbering the link's destination.  The
# temp file is created with O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW so a predictable temp name
# cannot be pre-planted as a symlink to redirect the write.  The original
# file's permission bits (and, where permitted, its owner/group) are copied
# onto the replacement so a group-writable shared file stays group-writable.
#
# Strategy 2 -- in-place rewrite (fallback).  Creating the temp needs WRITE
# access to the containing directory.  A common shared-game layout (see
# Explore's explore_setup.ec) makes the data directory NON-writable to players
# but pre-creates the data files writable -- the Unix analog of Multics
# per-segment ACLs, where you can write a segment without modify access to its
# directory.  When the temp create fails for that reason (EACCES/EPERM/EROFS),
# we fall back to rewriting the existing file in place, opened O_NOFOLLOW so a
# planted symlink at the path is still refused.  This loses atomicity for that
# one case, but it is the only way to honor the intended "writable file in a
# read-only directory" deployment.
#
# NOTE: neither strategy provides multi-writer locking; the whole-file rewrite
# model means concurrent writers can still lose updates.  Coordinating that is
# the embedder's responsibility (Explore uses advisory locking around its
# shared files).  What is fixed here is data-destruction: partial writes,
# symlink attacks, silent write errors, and permission/owner drift.

=head1 NAME

MBasic::File - a Multics BASIC terminal-format file channel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One terminal-format file channel.  Loads a file's lines on open (a missing
file is not an error -- it simply reads as immediately at-end, matching
Multics), serves sequential field and line reads, and appends writes.
Writes are flushed eagerly so that other processes see them immediately;
this is the behavior the Multics game works to achieve with its
adjust-bit-count and channel-reopen tricks, and on Unix it is automatic.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 open_path($path)

Class method.  Open a channel on a file, loading its content.

=head2 input_field / linput / print_chunk($text, $newline) / scratch / reset_pointer / at_end / close

Field read, whole-line read, buffered write, erase, rewind, end-of-file test,
and flush-and-close, respectively.
